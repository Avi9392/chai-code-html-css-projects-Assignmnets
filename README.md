Cursor & Mintlify Website Clones

This repository contains frontend clones of the Cursor and Mintlify landing pages built using only HTML and CSS.

Tech Used

HTML5

CSS3

No JavaScript was used in this project.

Project Details

Pixel-inspired layout recreation

Responsive structure using pure CSS

Clean UI replication of original websites

Organized sections and reusable styling

Note

In some sections, interactive elements originally built using JavaScript were replaced with static images.
This is because the assignment required using only HTML and CSS.

These sections will be updated with proper JavaScript functionality in future improvements.

Future Improvements

Add JavaScript for interactive features

Improve animations

Optimize responsiveness further
